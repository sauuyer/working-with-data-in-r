The files in this repository are used in  the Cushing/Whitney Meidcal Library's "Working with Data in R" workshop. This workshop demonstrates uses of the tidyverse packages including tidyr and dplyr (files 1 and 2). Files 3 and 4 provide more indepth examples of usecases for reshaping data for statistical tests and graphical applications (and these files leverage lubridate and ggpubr).
